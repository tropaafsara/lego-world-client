            <p>
            An access token is a credential that is used to authenticate and authorize a client application when accessing protected resources on a server. It is typically issued by an authentication server after a successful authentication process. Access tokens are short-lived and have an expiration time.
            When a client application needs to access a protected resource, it includes the access token in the requests sent to the server. The server verifies the validity and authorization of the access token to grant or deny access to the requested resource. If the access token expires, the client can use the refresh token to request a new access token without involving the user in the authentication process again.

            <h1 className='text-3xl mt-5'>2. Compare SQL and NoSQL databases?</h1>
            <p>SQL databases, also known as relational databases, use structured tables with predefined schemas and enforce relationships between tables using foreign keys. They primarily use SQL as a query language, excel in handling complex transactions, data integrity, and are well-suited for applications with structured data. On the other hand, NoSQL databases utilize flexible data models like key-value, document, columnar, or graph, allowing for dynamic schemas and scalability. They have specific query languages for each data model and are ideal for handling unstructured or semi-structured data, real-time data processing, and scenarios with frequent schema changes. Ultimately, the choice between SQL and NoSQL depends on the specific requirements and characteristics of the application.</p>
            <h1 className='text-3xl mt-5'>3. What is express js? What is Nest JS?</h1>
            <p>Express.js is a lightweight and flexible web application framework for Node.js, while NestJS is a progressive framework for building server-side applications with TypeScript, providing scalability and a modular architecture inspired by Angular.</p>
            <h1 className='text-3xl mt-5'>4. What is MongoDB aggregate and how does it work? </h1>
            <p>
In MongoDB, the aggregate function is used to perform advanced data processing operations on collections. It allows you to perform various operations like filtering, grouping, sorting, joining, and aggregating data within a collection.

The aggregate function works by taking an array of stages as input, where each stage represents a specific operation to be performed on the data. Each stage takes the output of the previous stage as its input and passes the transformed data to the next stage.

Stages in an aggregation pipeline can include operations like $match to filter documents, $group to group documents by specific fields, $sort to sort documents, $project to specify which fields to include or exclude in the output, $lookup to perform a left outer join with another collection, and many more.

By combining and chaining multiple stages in an aggregation pipeline, you can construct complex queries to transform and analyze your data in a flexible and powerful manner. Aggregation pipelines in MongoDB are highly versatile and can be used for tasks like data analysis, generating reports, and creating custom data views.

Overall, the MongoDB aggregate function provides a powerful framework for performing data processing and analysis operations on collections, enabling you to extract valuable insights and derive meaningful information from your data.</p>
